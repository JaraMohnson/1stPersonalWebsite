      I am thrilled to be starting fresh with new goals and a new career path.
      I've spent many years bartending, and had a great ride at Rocket Mortgage
      from 2019-2022. What brings me to tech is the ability to be creative again
      and have more flexibility with what I want to create.
    </p>

      My current developer goals are to finish my current C#/.NET bootcamp
      successfully, and then pursue further skillsets/languages, whether that be
      with a future employer or self-studies. I chose C# for its powerful
      capabilities as well as its versatility. I have family in the industry who
      work in client-facing, project management roles, and back-end
      developement. They were a huge part of the push to get me to pull the
      trigger and start on my own path.
    </p>

    <p>
      I grew up in Michigan, born and raised. There isn't much exciting to say
      about my hometown in Mid-Michigan, but I currently live in Metro Detroit
      with other small roots in St. Helen, MI and Sarasota, FL. My goal is to be
      able to work remotely, and live in a few cities before I find my forever
      home. The ocean is what calls me the most, so I'm positive I'll end up
      near the water somewhere in the US.
